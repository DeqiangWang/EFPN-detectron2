## EFPN implementation based on detectron2

To train:

run training scripts such as frcnn_x101_efpn.py as included here


Modifications from detectron2:

1. "detectron2" folder name changed to "detectron" to correctly build (could also work outside of root dir)

2. in detectron/modeling/backbone, we modified resnet.py and fpn.py to create the EFPN and FTT module

3. slight modifications to fix import paths, cuda compatibility...etc, including in detectron/engine/defaults.py, detectron/layers/wrappers.py


Todo:
1. create loss function for supervised and independent training of EFPN+FTT
